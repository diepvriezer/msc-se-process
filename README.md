| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| 18 Feb   | [Draft on errors](Ass2_Errors.md) |

- [ ] Questions to answer:
    - [ ] What type of errors are made during software development?
    - [ ] Why are they made?
    - [ ] How to prevent them (reviews, training, planned approach, pair programming, ..)?
    - [ ] What are the costs (impact, to fix, …)

One of the key aspects of professional development is to deliver working software. Organizations have different ways to prevent and to detect errors. There is a big trade off: eliminating all errors is costly and time consuming. Sometimes it’s better to deliver software with some errors that still delivers value. How to make sure that the software you deliver is “good enough”.

Use other relevant and recent papers to answer your questions.

- Leprechauns, chapter 10: "The cost of defects: an illustrated history".
- Making Software, chapter 25: Where do most Software Flaws come from?

- Ideas
    - Scale / open source
    - Most expensive bugs
    - Community trying to solve problems creates dozens more
    - What are you dependent on?
